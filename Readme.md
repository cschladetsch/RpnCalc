# RPN Calculator

A robust **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)** calculator implemented in Rust. This program supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and floating-point arithmetic with an easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`)
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Sine (`sin`), cosine (`cos`), tangent (`tan`)
- **Square Root**: `sqrt`
- **Floating-Point Arithmetic**: Handles decimal numbers
- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error messages for invalid inputs or insufficient operands

## How It Works

In Reverse Polish Notation:
- Operators follow their operands.
- No need for parentheses or operator precedence rules.

For example:
- Standard notation: `(3 + 4) * 2`
- RPN notation: `3 4 + 2 *`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Ensure Rust is installed. If not, download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
